# Heap Implementation and Sorting Algorithms

## Overview

## The content is:
  1. **Implementation of a heap structure**
  2. **Programming and comparison of two different sorting algorithms: insertion sort and heap sort**
  3. **Recognition of weighted graphs**

     
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your Linux machine (e.g., gcc).
- Make sure you have `make` installed.

### Compilation

To compile the program, open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory. Then, run the following command:
```bash
make
```

To test heap sorting of weighted graphs :
```bash
./main_test_poids
```

To test the speed difference between heap sort and insertion sort :
```bash
./main_test_tri
```
